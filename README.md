# THE-HUDDLE

### A REDDIT CLONE USING AN HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT FRONT-END AND A JAVA BACK-END

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION

American football isnâ€™t just a game. It is a battle between 22 evenly divided players. It requires immense strength, explosive power, agility, speed, and mental toughness. The sport is held dear by beloved fans that span the globe. And now, with The Huddle, fans can come together to share their opinions on the teams they champion.


This project was written to produce the back-end for a blog-like site. It provides the ability to create/save a user along with a user profile. It also provides log-in functionality with the ability to create, save, and delete posts and comments.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used to write the Java
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) An object-relational database system used with SQL
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A cool text editor used to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs

### APPROACH TAKEN
We began with utilizing Spring Initializer to build the project using Spring Frameworks. We added our dependencies and mapped out the goals for the application. This helped us understand how to progress through the application's development. Afterwards, we had to implement the functionality in stages. We mapped out all of the endpoints, their purpose, and the privileges needed to access them. We collaborated on a previous project, so the work flow was a lot more cohesive. COMMIT, COMMIT, COMMIT!!

We worked together to set goals and deadlines, and we kept to them. We made sure not to get caught up in the impossible by thinking about what needed to be accomplished rather than what we wanted to be accomplished. We also did a lot of pair programming, so we were able to error-check and learn from each other.
