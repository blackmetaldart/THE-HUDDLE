### SWAPIFY - A REDDIT CLONE USING JAVA AND SPRING FRAMEWORK

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION


### IMAGES

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
This project was initialized on the Spring Frameworks Initializer. We wrote in the Java language and used the IntelliJ IDEA. We used Postgres to manipulate our databases and Maven dependencies to add additional functionality to our site. We had an understanding of SQL, and are starting to incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this a full-stack application.

## APPROACH TAKEN
Our approach began with utilizing Spring technology. We mapped out the goals for the application. This helped us understand how to progress through the development of the application. Afterwards, we had to implement the functionality in stages. We mapped out all of the endpoints, their purpose, and the privileges needed to access them. We rebuilt the project four times because we didnt know how to troubleshoot Spring Framework technology in the IntelliJ environment. We also didn’t think to add the repo to a Git flow because we didn’t grasp the concept of VCS (Version Control System).
